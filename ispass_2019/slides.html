# Introduction

---

# Large amounts of physical memory

- Up to terabytes supported by modern computing systems.
- To accommodate memory-hungry applications such as in-memory databases.

---

# Virtual memory

- Immensely useful
  - A linear address space abstraction: easy to program
  - Isolation: security and reliability
  - Overcommitment: use more memory than physically available
  - Share physical memory: deduplication
  - ...
- Ubiquitous
--

- Not without overhead
- **Address translation**
--

- Virtual-to-physical translation information stored in page tables
--

- Accessing page tables to perform a translation (i.e. page walk) is expensive
  - 4-level page table organization in recent generations of x86 processors
  - Up to *hundreds* of cycles to do a single page walk
--

- Translation lookaside buffers (TLBs) cache recently used translations
  - Down to &lt;10 cycles
  - Problem solved?

---

# A TLB has limited capacity

- Cannot scale at the same rate as physical memory
- Latency and energy efficiency constraints
--

- From Haswell (2013) to Kaby Lake (2018), Intel's second-level TLB grew from 1024 entries to 1536 entries.
- In the meantime, supported physical memory has more than doubled.

---

# Instruction access vs data access

- Different protections: RX vs. RW
--

- Different sizes: data usually accounts for the majority of an application's memory footprint.
--

- Different locality
--

- Different "criticality"
--

- Many have sought to reduce address translation overhead for data accesses.
  - Gorman et al. (WIOSCA 2010), Ingens (OSDI 16), SmartMD (ATC 17), Carrefour-LP (ATC 14), Illuminator (ASPLOS 18), Basu et al. (ISCA 13), Karakostas et al. (ISCA 15), TLB coalescing (MICRO 12, HPCA 14, ISCA 17), ...

# But what about address translation overhead on instruction accesses?

---

# Instruction Address Translation Overhead

- Much less attention has been paid to the performance impact of this overhead, at either the architectural or operating system level.
--

- On an Intel Xeon E3-1240 v5 (Skylake) processor, the PostgreSQL database executing a select-only workload spends up to **14.9%** of its execution cycles stalled on instruction address translation.
--

- Intel documentation recommends that instruction address translation stalls be kept under **5%** of execution cycles.
--

- Overhead exacerbated by two trends.
    1. The ever increasing size and complexity of the applications.
        - The Clang compiler has increased in size from 31MB of x86 machine code in version 3.0 (2012) to 56MB in version 6.0.0 (2018).
        - A recent version of the Node.js run-time environment uses 20 shared libraries.
--
    2. The ever increasing parallelism in modern applications and hardware platforms: greater competition for shared hardware resources, such as TLBs and caches.
        - Multi-core and SMT.
        - Multi-process applications (e.g. PostgreSQL) and multi-process workloads (e.g. parallel compilation with Clang).

- **Superpages**
- Padding and Page Table Sharing
- Conclusions and Future Work

---

# Superpages

- Increase TLB coverage.
- Modern processors support superpages of potentially multiple sizes.
- TLBs provide a growing number of entries for superpage mappings.
--

- Skylake TLB configuration.

---

# OS Support for Code Superpages

- Linux does not transparently support superpages on code from a regular file system.
- FreeBSD automatically and transparently supports code from any file system.
--

  - Reservation-based page allocator
  - Incremental promotion
  - A conservative policy

# The Impact of FreeBSD's Automatic Code Superpages

# The Impact on Data Address Translation

- The second-level TLB is shared between code and data.
--

- Improving address translation performance in the ITLB can significantly
  reduce the address translation overhead for data accesses!

- Residual code region
--

- Mapped as 4KB base pages
- Hundreds of mappings
  - PostgreSQL accesses more than 64 of these pages.
  - 4KB page mappings spill into the STLB, potentially displacing 2MB page mappings for data.

# Outline

- Introduction
- x86 Instruction Address Translation
- Superpages
- **Padding and Page Table Sharing**
- Conclusions and Future Work

---

# Padding

- Pad out the residual code region so that it can be mapped as a superpage.
--

- Two ways
    - Ask the *linker* to bloat the executable segment up to the next superpage boundary.
    - The *kernel* automatically extends the executable mapping up to the next superpage boundary, back the residual code region with a reservation, and fill in the gap following residual code.
        - Optimization: pages backing the data segment can be used as part of the padding.

---

# Page Table Sharing

- Shared libraries
  - Too small to be mapped as superpages.
  - Common libraries are referenced across different processes and applications, e.g. libc, libcrypto, libm, libthr, libssl.
--

- Share leaf-level page table pages!

---

# Page Table Sharing

![x86 Address Translation](./x86_addr_trans_5.svg)

---

# Page Table Sharing

- Leaf-level page table pages (PTPs) outlive the processes referencing them.
- Attach the shared PTPs to the *vm_object*, which tracks a file's resident pages.
- Use an unused and non-reserved bit in the higher level page table entry to mark the presence of a lower-level shared PTP in the page table hierarchy.
- Force 2MB virtual alignment of (executable) text sections to maximize usage of shared PTPs across processes with different address space layouts.

---

# Page Table Sharing

- De-duplicates page table data in the LLC.
- Leads to significantly fewer data and instruction page table walk cycles.
--


PostgreSQL average cycles per instruction page table walk with and without page table sharing.

---

# Padding and Page Table Sharing

- Reduce the amount of work done in the OS.
  - Process creation and teardown become faster.
--

    - Padding: hundreds of leaf-level PTEs replaced with just a single upper-level PTE.
    - Page table sharing:
      - Insert entire shared PTPs directly at process creation.
      - Skip over shared PTPs during process teardown.

# Padding and Page Table Sharing

- Execution cycles reduced by more than the instruction address translation overhead.
  - The data side is synergistically benefiting from less contention in the STLB and caches.

# Conclusions

- The overhead of instruction address translation for a variety of widely used applications is non-trivial.
  - This overhead increases as the level of parallelism goes up in modern applications and hardware platforms.
- Three techniques help reduce instruction address translation overhead and therefore reduce overall execution cycles.
  - Relaxing the superpage promotion policy for code.
  - Padding residual code.
  - Sharing page tables pages.
- Improving address translation performance in the ITLB can reduce the address translation overhead for data accesses.
  - Many modern microarchitectures share the STLB between instruction and data translations.

# Future Work

- Interaction with compile-time optimizations.
- Medium-sized mappings, e.g. 64KB mappings.
